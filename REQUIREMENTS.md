# Chat



## Requirements MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

- Use [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) obviously.
- [socket.io](https://socket.io/) on the backend.
- socket.io-client on the frontend.
- You must use the [login starter](http://gitlab.perryville.perseverenow.org/cohort-06/login-starter), so MERN and Tailwind.
- You must have at least 2 rooms.
- You must have at least 2 users in using 2 different tabs.
- You don't have to use the login and authentication, but it is highly recommended.
- If you do use logins, you will need to use sessionStorage instead of localStorage for presentation and testing purposes.




## Getting Started

Start with the [login starter](http://gitlab.perryville.perseverenow.org/cohort-06/login-starter).
- Copy the code from the login starter (without the .git folder) and paste it into your new chat project.
- This should be your first commit, **"Initial setup from login-starter."**.
- The READMEs in the [login starter](http://gitlab.perryville.perseverenow.org/cohort-06/login-starter) will help you the rest of the way.




## Tech stack

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- MERN
- react-router
- CRUD
- Tailwind



## Optional

- Show number of connected users.
- Put server socket actions behind Express routes and authentication.
- Require user to be logged in to access chat rooms.
- Add avatar image to database in user record.
- Save messages to database.
- On page refresh, X last number of messages saved to database should show.
- Allows users to communicate directly with each other, like rooms.
- Add a chat bot to a room.



## Concepts

### You should be able to explain ...
- Using human words what we are trying to do technically.
- How to structure data to accommodate rooms and messages.
- How to store an image in the database without file uploads.
- How to get [socket.io](https://socket.io/) and React to work together.
- The way we chose to get [socket.io](https://socket.io/) and Express to work together.
